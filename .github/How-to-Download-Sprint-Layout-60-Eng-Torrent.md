After you have downloaded and installed Sprint Layout 6.0, you can start designing your own PCBs. Here are some basic steps to follow:

1. Launch Sprint Layout 6.0 and create a new file. You can choose the size and shape of your board, the number of layers, and the grid settings.
2. Select the components you need from the library or create your own with the Footprint-Wizard. You can drag and drop them on the board and rotate them as you wish.
3. Connect the components with tracks or wires. You can use the automatic capture mode to snap them to the nearest pad or hole. You can also use the rubber-band function to adjust the tracks automatically when you move a component.
4. Add text labels, zones, shapes, or other elements to your board. You can use the anti-alias function to smooth the edges of your graphics.
5. Check your design for errors with the Design-Rule-Check function. It will highlight any overlaps, shorts, or unconnected pads.
6. Save your file and export it as Gerber or Excellon format for manufacturing. You can also export it as Pick+Place data for automated assembly.

Sprint Layout 6.0 is a powerful and easy-to-use software for PCB design. You can create professional-looking boards with minimal effort and time.

If you want to see some examples of PCBs designed with Sprint Layout 6.0, you can watch some videos on YouTube that show the process and the results. For instance, you can watch this video[^1^] by MKDas, who shows how to design a PCB for a simple LED flasher circuit. He explains how to use the tools and functions of Sprint Layout 6.0, such as the selector, the track width, the pad size, the ground plane, and the autorouter. He also shows how to print the PCB layout and how to etch it with ferric chloride.
 
Another example of a PCB designed with Sprint Layout 6.0 is this video by Stefano91ste, who shows how to design a PCB for a music keyboard project. He demonstrates how to use the macros for adding components, how to connect them with tracks and wires, how to add text labels and shapes, and how to export the Gerber files for manufacturing. He also shows the final PCB and how it works with an Arduino Nano and a buzzer.
 
These are just some of the many examples of PCBs designed with Sprint Layout 6.0 that you can find online. You can also check out the official website of Sprint Layout 6.0 for more information and tutorials.
